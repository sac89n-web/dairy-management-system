Common PostgreSQL passwords to try in dbconfig.json:

1. "postgres" (most common default)
2. "admin" 
3. "password"
4. "123456"
5. "" (empty string)
6. "root"

Replace the "Password" field in dbconfig.json with each of these until one works.

Or check your pgAdmin connection:
1. Open pgAdmin
2. Right-click your server â†’ Properties
3. Go to Connection tab
4. Use the exact same Host, Port, Username, and Password in dbconfig.json
